Wheatpaste is a "all the shit relevant to this project goes here" repo for a PyPortal app which queries an API, as well as for the API server which condenses info from multiple APIs and spits it out as one reponse for easier parsing by the PyPortal app.

This is a specific project with a specific purpose made for a specific person. I would not expect you to find anything terribly useful or helpful or inspirational here, but the repo is public because I could be and often am wrong.

How to use:
Probably don't.
