This is an "all the shit relevant to this project goes here" repo for a PyPortal app which ~~queries an API, as well as for the API server which condenses info from multiple APIs and spits it out as one reponse for easier parsing by the PyPortal app~~ no longer does any of this because the APIs I was using were unfit for this purpose. It now does something else.

This is a specific project with a specific purpose made for a specific person. I would not expect you to find anything terribly useful or helpful or inspirational here, but the repo is public because I could be and often am wrong. Also, a good chunk of this code was written on various forms of transit and as such is not suitable for human consumption.

How to use:
Probably don't.
